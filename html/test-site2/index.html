    <h1>Getting Started (Again) with HTML</h1>
    <p>This is my second attempt at creating an HTML document. The first HTML document was based around the
        <strong>Mozilla Developer Edition</strong> icon.
    </p>
    <p>That first HTML document can be found <a
            href="file:///Users/peterg.morales/Desktop/MDN-web-projects/test-site/index.html">here.</a></p>
    <p>I'm very excited to get into more detail regarding HTML. MDN has made this very fun.</p>
